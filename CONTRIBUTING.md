# Welcome

Hello! Thanks for taking an interest in this project and code.
Contributions to this project are welcome of course, otherwise it wouldn't reside on GitHub ðŸ˜ƒ however there's a few things to be aware of:

This is a personal project, it is not maintained by a team or group.
It might take a long time for the maintainer(s) to reply to issues or review PRs, they will have have a day jobs & might not have looked at the code for a while.
The code here is likely to not be bullet proof & production grade, there might be a lack of unit tests or other practices missing from the code base.

# Contributing
There's several ways of contributing to this project, and effort has been made to make this as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

1. Reporting a bug
2. Discussing the current state of the code
3. Submitting a fix
4. Proposing new features
5. Becoming a maintainer


All code changes happen though pull requests (PRs)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (using the standard Github Flow).
Some PR guidance:

Please keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or change, with discreet commits. Use multiple PRs if need be.
If you're thinking of adding a feature via a PR please create an issue first where it can be discussed.

# High level steps:

Fork the repo and create your branch from master or main.
If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
Ensure the test suite (if any) passes (run make lint).
Make sure your code lints (run make lint).
Issue that pull request!
